Chris Benjaminsen and Brian Meidell, veterans of the video game industry, 
launched FRVR in 2014 intending to make games more accessible to anybody, 
at any time, and anywhere. Over the years, FRVR has led the quest to
democratize game distribution by removing barriers that gamers may face 
when playing their favorite games.
The idea behind FRVR AI is to make the game creation process accessible 
and simple for anyone who wants to express their creativity, whether it’s 
bringing a long-held vision to life or entering the game development field 
to monetize this craft further.

Getting started is extremely easy: users simply provide the AI model with a 
brief description of the game they wish to create. After that, FRVR’s AI 
engine develops the game’s basic structure, logic, and assets, making it 
playable right away. Further users can refine the gameplay or visuals by 
simply interacting with the tool through written instructions until they 
are satisfied with the final result.
